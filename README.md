# Autonomous Sub Pixel Detection and Trajectory Mapping of Floating Marine Macroplastics 

Marine plastic pollution is a massive and growing problem: current estimates place “millions of tons” of floating plastic in the world’s oceans, with enormous quantities entering each year[1]. These plastics accumulate because they degrade extremely slowly. Although tiny microplastics are most numerous, macro- (>5 cm) and mega-plastics actually make up most of the floating plastic mass[1]. Traditional surveys (e.g. floating booms, manual counts, river/boat sampling) are extremely labor-intensive and geographically limited[2]. As one recent review notes, existing in‐situ monitoring is “inconsistent over time and space” and “labor‐intensive, costly, [and] geographically limited”[2]. In short, conventional site surveys cannot track the vast scale and dynamics of plastic debris across oceans. Satellite remote sensing offers a much larger coverage and high revisit rates, raising the hope of mapping and even forecasting plastic drifts.


However, detecting floating plastic in satellite imagery poses unique technical challenges. First, plastics often mimic natural sea clutter. Common marine debris (seaweed, sargassum, driftwood, sea foam, etc.) have reflectance spectra very similar to weathered plastics, causing severe spectral confusion[3][4]. For example, polystyrene (PS) debris can be as bright as Sargassum on the surface, polyethylene foam looks like natural foam, and wood or seaweed often reflect like polypropylene[3][4]. This means that any detection algorithm must robustly distinguish plastics from look-alikes.

Second, resolution limits pose a hurdle: typical public satellite data (e.g. Sentinel-2 MSI) have ~10 m pixels, whereas plastic fragments or aggregates may be much smaller or only cover a fraction of a pixel. Recent studies confirmed that sub-pixel detection is indeed possible. For instance, Biermann et al. (2020) introduced the Floating Debris Index (FDI) and showed it can reveal plastic targets even when they only occupy a small portion of a Sentinel-2 pixel[5][6]. Likewise, a 2024 Marine Pollution Bulletin study used Sentinel-2 FDI to detect sub-pixel plastic patches intermingled with seaweed and foam in Brazil[7]. These works demonstrate that index-based features (like FDI and modified NDVI) can amplify the subtle plastic signal within mixed pixels.


Third, biofouling and weathering alter plastic’s spectral signature. As plastic drifts, it accumulates algae and microbes on its surface. Over time this “biofilm” both dims the bright plastic reflectance and can even cause plastics to sink. Experiments show that biofilm growth (even a thin coating of algae) significantly reduces a plastic’s brightness[8][9]. In the ocean this effect can be compounded by trapped sediment. Indeed, recent controlled studies found that plastic items lose reflectance and eventually sink as biofilms grow[10][9]. Thus a detection system must account for time-varying dampening of plastic’s spectral signal.
Taken together, the problem requires a sophisticated, multi-part solution. Key components include spectral analysis (indices and libraries), machine learning detection, physics-based drift modeling, and a decision-support dashboard. Below we discuss each.


## Spectral Indices and Sub-Pixel Detection

Researchers have developed custom indices to enhance the contrast of plastics versus water. The Floating Debris Index (FDI) is one prominent example. FDI is designed to highlight anomalies with high NIR reflectance (like plastics or foam) against the dark water background[5][7]. In practice, analysts compute FDI (sometimes in combination with vegetation indices like NDVI) and threshold it to pinpoint likely debris pixels[5][7]. Studies confirm that FDI dramatically improves detectability: one field-validated study found FDI was “the most important variable for detecting marine floating plastic” in machine-learning models[11]. A recent Brazilian case study used FDI and achieved sub-pixel-scale detection of macroplastics mixed with seaweed and foam[7].


More advanced approaches fuse multiple data sources. For example, the ESA “REACT” project fused Sentinel-2 multispectral with higher-resolution hyperspectral or panchromatic data (PRISMA, WorldView) and applied spectral unmixing. In this approach, each pixel is modeled as a linear mix of “endmember” spectra (pure water, vegetation, plastic). By unmixing, one can estimate a fractional abundance of plastic in each pixel[12]. Indeed, REACT reported that spectral signature unmixing “separated endmember spectral [signals] that best characterize plastic materials and water”, yielding abundance maps that highlighted the plastic targets[12]. These abundance maps are essentially sub-pixel probability maps of plastics. In parallel, REACT explored machine learning on the fused data: AI classifiers (e.g. supervised ML) produced probability maps for plastic presence[13]. The project found that data fusion plus unmixing often outperformed raw deep learning on low-resolution data, though ML methods still gave “promising results” when enough training examples were available[14].


In practice, one would likely combine indices, unmixing, and ML. For instance, a neural network (CNN or vision transformer) could be trained on Sentinel-2 bands plus derived indices (FDI, NDVI, etc.) as input channels[5][12]. Convolutional nets can learn spatial patterns (e.g. edges of debris patches), while a transformer could capture larger context (improving robustness to noise). Some existing works already apply deep learning for this task (see below). Importantly, any detection model should be tuned on in-situ or simulated training data reflecting mixed pixels and confusers, since pure-library spectra rarely match real floating debris[15][3].


## Spectral Confusion and Biofouling

Spectral confusion is a core challenge. Sargassum algae and foam are particularly troublesome: they share green/NIR reflectance features with plastics[3][4]. For example, a patch of white polystyrene can have a very similar VNIR reflectance curve as a patch of foam or a driftwood surface[3][4]. Even oily water or certain plankton blooms can mimic plastic’s signature. These overlaps mean models must use subtle cues: tiny differences in band ratios, the presence of specific absorption features (e.g. plastic often has slight absorption near 1215–1450 nm)[16][17], or multi-angle polarization data. Some studies suggest using polarimetric or shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands to separate plastics from algae, since algae have strong chlorophyll absorption at ~665 nm which plastics lack[4][18]. In short, a robust system will leverage multiple spectral regions (visible, NIR, SWIR) and possibly polarization to reduce false positives.


Biofouling/weathering adds another layer of complexity. As plastics age at sea, microbes and algae colonize them, altering their apparent color. Empirical experiments show that a biofilm layer tends to lower the reflectance across VNIR bands[8][9]. Effectively, the plastic becomes darker and can even turn greenish. Over weeks or months, this can push a plastic object’s signature closer to surrounding algae or water. Worse, heavy fouling (with trapped sediments) can increase the object’s density so it sinks[10]. This means a detection pipeline should not assume a constant spectral signature for plastic; rather, it may model a time-dependent dimming. One approach is to build a biofouling spectral library: Leonne et al. (2023) created a dataset of plastics under controlled biofilm growth and found marked changes in reflectance[19][9]. Models can use such data to learn how classification confidence decays over time, or to correct the indices for expected fouling. On the other hand, once heavy fouling sinks the plastic, it will no longer be seen by optical satellites – a hard limit of the method. In summary, biofouling acts as an attenuating factor on the RGB/NIR signal; any long-term monitoring must include a physics-based or empirical attenuation model.

## Deep Learning Detection Pipelines

Given the complexity above, a deep learning pipeline is well-suited. A possible architecture: use Sentinel-2 imagery (10 m resolution) as input, possibly stacked with computed index layers (FDI, NDVI, etc.)[5][7]. A CNN (or U-Net) could be trained to output a probability map of plastic presence at the pixel (or sub-pixel) level. In practice, because plastics may occupy <20% of a pixel, one could train the network in a regression or fractional output mode (predicting the plastic fraction). Alternatively, one could use object-detection frameworks (e.g. YOLO) on higher-resolution satellites (if available) to pinpoint debris clusters, and then cross-reference those with the lower-res maps.


Vision Transformers (ViT) are another option. Transformers naturally capture large-scale context, which may help disambiguate plastics in clutter (a patch of signal against similar background can be informed by patterns elsewhere in the image). While we lack a published plastic-detection ViT study, similar methods have succeeded in land cover classification and would likely transfer. Importantly, training such models requires substantial labeled data. Some approaches combine simulated data (e.g. adding known plastic spectra to satellite scenes) with any available real in-situ observations. Pretraining on generic ocean/land imagery before fine-tuning on plastic data can also help.


Whatever the model, feature fusion is key. For example, Digital Earth Africa’s notebook on floating debris shows combining FDI and NDVI improves accuracy. Including spectral unmixing results (as an extra channel) is also feasible: one can feed the network not just raw bands but also unmixing-derived abundance maps[12]. In practice, a mixed strategy emerges in the literature: use machine learning to classify pixels flagged by spectral indices, or embed index computation into a CNN’s first layer. A recent review noted that ML/DL methods are “effective” for large plastic patches and can operate at scale[11][20].

## Trajectory and Dispersion Modeling
Detecting plastics is only half the battle – for actionable monitoring one needs to predict where debris will drift next. Here physics-based modeling comes in. The primary drivers are ocean currents and wind. Currents advect floating particles, while wind applies a “windage” force on their exposed surfaces. Modern trajectory models (e.g. the open-source OpenDrift framework[21]) can ingest gridded current fields (from ocean models or satellite altimetry), wind fields, and even Stokes drift (wave-induced drift) to simulate particle motion. OpenDrift and similar tools have been widely used for oil spills and search-and-rescue, and they apply equally to buoyant plastics.

### Key aspects of a plastic-drift model include:


•	`Windage factor`: typically a small percentage of wind speed (~1–5%) is imparted to the surface litter, depending on how much of the object protrudes above water[3][22]. In other words, a model must estimate the fraction of plastic above the waterline to compute wind drag.


•	`Advection-diffusion`: ocean currents move objects over large scales, but turbulent dispersion (modeled as diffusion) spreads them out.


•	`Temporal integration`: given a detection at time t, one seeds virtual particles there and steps them forward in time (or even runs the model backward to estimate source). Such ensemble simulations yield probability fields of future positions.


These drift forecasts can be integrated with the image-based detections. For example, once the CNN flags plastic in pixel coordinates, we can launch a particle “cloud” from that location and let physics models carry it forward. Real-time wind and ocean data feeds (from e.g. ECMWF, HYCOM, Mercator) allow frequent re-forecasting. Crucially, drifting simulations also help differentiate between accumulation zones and transitory patches. For instance, a plume detected today might disperse in days; another spot of debris might congregate in an ocean front. Tools like OpenDrift have been explicitly used in research (and by organizations like The Ocean Cleanup) to identify long-lived accumulation zones (“garbage patches”)[21][23].


## Governmental Dashboard & Hotspot Forecasting


Finally, the outputs need to be communicated in an actionable way. A centralized “Marine Debris Dashboard” for authorities would ingest the detection+forecast data to highlight risk areas. Such dashboards exist in concept: The Ocean Cleanup’s Plastic Tracker map and Ocean Cleanup research emphasize modeling debris fate to pinpoint hotspots[23][24]. A dashboard could present (a) current satellite detections of high plastic likelihood, (b) forecast drifts over the next days/weeks, and (c) accumulation “heatmaps” derived from multi-day drift simulations. One could define a Marine Debris Density Index (similar to Booth et al.’s MDM) which combines the mean detection confidence with frequency of detections in an area[24]. Regions with persistently high MDM would be flagged as cleanup priority zones. Interactive maps could allow users to query drift forecasts from any release point, overlay currents and wind, and schedule field operations accordingly.

In practice, to build this system one would integrate: (1) the trained detection model scanning new satellite images for plastic; (2) a biofouling-correction module that adjusts detection confidence based on expected signal decay; (3) a drift-model engine (e.g. OpenDrift) that runs automatically on the detections; and (4) a web dashboard that visualizes detections, forecast trajectories, and “hotspot” analytics.

## Sources: We draw on recent remote sensing studies of ocean plastics[5][7][12], spectral reflectance research including biofouling effects[3][8], and the literature on marine debris drift modeling[21][23] to outline this approach. These show that combining spectral indices, data fusion, machine learning, and physics-driven simulations is the promising path forward for autonomous plastic monitoring at sea.
